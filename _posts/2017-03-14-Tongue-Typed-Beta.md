[Tongue Typed](http://tonguetyped.launchrock.com) is the best way to keep your blog pumped with amazing content. We create great blogs with your ideas and knowledge. You think, we make!

Tongue Typed is the slickest, quickest, easiest writing support service you've ever seen. Chat to us in Messenger (for the Beta). Voice note your thoughts, pop in relevant links, and sit back and relax while we turn your brain soup into textual gold. You think it, we write it. Awesomesauce.

Ok, one more time? We know that you know that writing blogs for your business is super important. You have to show your customers that you know your stuff, and all that content boosts your SEO ranking in all your favourite search engines. But we also know how tough it is to run a good business, put your clients first, do all the stuff, and then to still find time to write decent blog posts. That's where we come in.

You're always thinking about your business; that's what makes you so good at it! So take one of those thoughts, pop into messenger, hit the voice note button and explain it to us, and boom! We'll write out a perfect blog post for that thought and send it back to you ready to upload. We take the expertise that's already in your head, and get it in front of your clients!

As this post has hinted a few times, we're kinda in Beta, so there's nothing too fancy going on here. Do you need blog posts? Then hit us up on FB Messenger and let's make it happen.
