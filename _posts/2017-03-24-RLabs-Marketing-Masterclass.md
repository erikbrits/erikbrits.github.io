Hello!

Below are some of the more thought-provoking articles I've read in the last 6 months. Modern marketing is evolving at such a rapid pace that text books struggle to keep up. Once you’ve internalized the fundamental processes of a good marketer, your next growth phase comes from keeping an eye on the industry, and analysing what your competitors are doing. Remember to be politely critical: If they are doing it, try to understand why they thought it was a good idea… but always decide for yourself whether it is a good idea for your situation or not.

The ideas you take away from this list should be your own. For example, here are 5 of mine, relevant to my situation.



Globalisation, connectivity and the future of branding: We are very close to the point where being the most conveniently available product or service will no longer matter, as consumers will be able to choose the service that “speaks to them” the best. Instead of simply selling better products and services, it will become unavoidably essential to understand who your customer is and to directly address their needs in a personal manner with your brand.

Cartman and Virality: If you do something truly special, something truly magical, you could reach the entire world. Is this good or bad? That depends. Are you selling a something really complicated, specialized, or niche? It might just be more distraction / hassle than it’s worth being flooded with global, general traffic. Can you ship outside South Africa? If not, this could lead to negative feelings in the long run. But if the global exposure is right for you, it’s frustrating and motivating at the same time to know that it could happen because of one click! It is important to remember that “hoping to go viral” is not a marketing plan. A solid marketing plan is one that generates regular interest in your brand, and creates opportunities that could lead to vitality… but the actual vitality is the cherry on top.

Personal branding vs. company branding: If you look closely enough at the details of how to maintain your personal online reputation, you should see a lot of similarities to business branding. It is helpful to realize that the fundamental principle of *business* branding online is to be a “good citizen” - be polite, friendly, appropriate, reachable, and present in the right places. This is good and bad: Good because you can easily check whether you’re doing the right thing or not by asking yourself, “would I want a human to treat me like this”… and bad because it means you can’t (well, shouldn’t) fake it. Your company has to actually care about its clients!

How how how how how do emojis make people rich?! Yes this comment refers to the Kim Kardashian article. This one really made me think. The biggest takeaway for me personally was that you have to respect the fact that Kim Kardashian sees opportunity in people making fun of her. Rather than trying to maintain a perfect image, she’s said “ok well they want to make fun of me? I’ll *sell* them a sticker to do that with!” There a bit more to this piece though, relating back to the first article I highlighted about how personal and embedded our communications with brands are becoming, and how the lines are blurring between business and personal. It’s hard to predict the future, but if I had to start a business today, I would make the story very personal - make it real, make it human, make it important to someone.

What could businesses learn from non-profit organisations?! Well now… imagine persuading someone to pay you for a product they need. Now, imagine persuading them to pay you for a product they don’t need or understand, and which you’re going to give to someone else anyway! Yeah, turns out there’s a lot to be learnt from how non-profits persuade people to get involved, how they make them care, and how they make them pay.
