  <h1> {{ page.title }} </h1>
    <p> I am a South African business strategist who currently creates luxury wildlife safaris for a living while running a coworking space, launching a digital agency, and building a startup incubator. In short, I am fundamentally excited about doing business, and firmly believe in having hands on experience. Ideas are cheap, execution is important, and failure is the glue that binds the road to success.</p>
    <p>In a past life I researched an online guidebook for South Africa, studied Astrophysics, studied Economics, and won a startup weekend (all in disparate phases). I read more sci-fi and fantasy than I should, and get outdoors less than I should, but Iâ€™m interested in just about everything.</p>
